   SEEDWORLD — multiplayer relay
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   One Durable Object per world seed. It does not simulate anything: clients
   own their own movement, the room takes deltas, clamps the obvious nonsense,
   and fans them out to whoever is close enough to care.

   The 600 ms synchronisation does NOT happen here. Clients derive their tick
   number from wall clock (Date.now() + offset), and this Worker's only role in
   that is echoing timestamps for the offset estimate. That is deliberate — a
   server-side tick loop would keep the Durable Object awake permanently and
   an empty world would cost money.

   The seed is the world. One account, one character per seed: `players` holds
   who you are, `characters` holds who you are *there*.

/* ===================== THE ARCHIVE (D1 is a cache) =======================
   D1 is capped at 10 GB and the cap cannot be raised, so `characters` cannot be
   where ten million saves live. It is instead a hot cache: a character sits in
   D1 while it is being played and for ARCH_IDLE afterwards, then a cron sweep
   writes the blob to R2 and deletes the row. The table therefore never grows
   past roughly the concurrent player count, whatever the account count is — and
   because it stays small, the sweep's `WHERE updated < ?` can scan it without an
   index, which matters: indexing `updated` would put a written row back on every
   save, the exact cost this whole design removes.

   R2 is the permanent copy and is never pruned. Storage is $0.015/GB-month
   against D1's $0.75 — fifty times cheaper — with no ceiling to plan around.

   The key is keyed by player FIRST so that one prefix list gives a player every
   character they have ever had, which is what the world-select screen needs once
   their rows have left D1.

   Everything here degrades: with no R2 binding the game runs exactly as it did

   The indexes are deliberately few. D1 bills a row written per index the write
   touches, so a column that changes on every save must not appear in one:
   `characters` therefore carries no secondary index at all — its (pid, seed)
   primary key already serves both `WHERE pid=?` (leading prefix) and the
   per-seed lookup, and nothing in the save upsert's SET list is indexed, so a
   save bills exactly one row. `houses` is keyed (seed, pid) rather than
   (pid, seed)'s natural order because the only read is by seed; that lets the
   primary key do the work an extra index used to. `ge_book` is partial on the
